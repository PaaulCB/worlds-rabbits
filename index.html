                <span>Description:</span>The Netherland Dwarf is a breed of
                domestic rabbit that originated in the Netherlands. Weighing
                0.50-1.13 kg the Netherland Dwarf is one of the smallest rabbit
                breeds. Its popularity as a pet or show rabbit may stem from its
                neotenic appearance. The Netherland Dwarf is recognised by both
                the American Rabbit Breeders Association (ARBA) and the British
                Rabbit Council (BRC). The Netherland Dwarf is often confused
                with the Polish breed of rabbit, but the latter has longer ears,
                a non-brachycephalic head and less cobbiness.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span>Appearance:</span> The Netherland Dwarf's head and eyes
                are disproportionately large with respect to its short-coupled
                and stout ("cobby") body. Its ears are notably short and carried
                high on the head and its face is rounded and brachycephalic.
                These neotenic features, a result of dwarfism, cause the
                Netherland Dwarf to retain an infantile appearance even into
                adulthood.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span>Behaviour:</span>Netherland Dwarf rabbits can be
                litter-trained, as they have a natural tendency to choose the
                same spot for their droppings, and a much higher intelligence
                than most rabbits, making it easier to litter train them.
                Netherland Dwarfs can be skittish, wild and/or of a disagreeable
                nature. This is a leftover stereotype from the beginnings of the
                breed. This has changed through selective breeding; however,
                they are skittish and aloof. They are extremely active and
                energetic, requiring the same amount of exercise as other breeds
                of rabbit. They also have a higher tendency towards nervousness
                and stress. As with any species, disposition will vary from
                individual to individual.

                <span>Description:</span> The Flemish Giant rabbit is the
                largest breed of domestic rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus
                domesticus). Flemish Giants are historically a utility breed
                used for their fur and meat. They are often kept as pets as they
                are known for being docile and patient when being handled.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span>Appearance:</span> As one of the largest breeds of
                domestic rabbit, the Flemish Giant is a semi-arch type rabbit
                with its back arch starting behind the shoulders and carrying
                through to the base of the tail, giving a "mandolin" shape. The
                body of a Flemish Giant Rabbit is long and powerful, with
                relatively broad hindquarters. The fur of the Flemish Giant is
                glossy and dense. When stroked from the hindquarters to the
                head, the fur will roll back to its original position. Bucks
                have a broad, massive head in comparison to does, and can take
                1.5 years to reach full maturity. Does may have a large, full,
                evenly carried dewlap (the fold of skin under their chins), and
                can take 1 year to reach full maturity.Flemish Giant rabbits
                weigh 6.8 kilograms (15 lb) on average, though the largest ones
                can weigh up to 10 kilograms (22 lb). The longest one on record
                (which holds the record for the longest rabbit in the world of
                any kind), measured about 1.3 metres (4 ft 3 in) long.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span>Behaviour:</span> Flemish Giants can be docile and
                tolerant of being handled if they frequently have interactions
                with humans.

                <span>Description:</span>Holland Lop is a breed of lop-eared
                rabbit that was recognized by the American Rabbit Breeders
                Association (ARBA) in 1979. The Holland Lop, with a maximum
                weight of 1.8 kg (as stipulated by ARBA), is one of the smallest
                lop-eared breeds.Holland Lops are one of the most popular rabbit
                breeds in the United States and the United Kingdom. They were
                first bred by Dutch breeder Adrian de Cock, as a hybrid of the
                French Lop and the Netherland Dwarf. Holland Lops are miniature
                rabbits that only weigh from about 2 to 4 pounds. They are
                muscular in relation to their compact frame, and have a wide
                variety of coat colours. Their lopped ears are one of their most
                distinctive features.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span>Appearance:</span> According to the Holland Lop show
                standards, they are expected to be muscular for their short
                size. "Broad shoulders and deep hindquarters" are expected
                traits from a high quality Holland Lop, according to a judge
                from the Holland Lop Specialty Club. They also added that the
                legs should be "thick, short, and heavily boned." In shows, the
                body is worth a total of 32 points. The Holland Lop is typically
                60 cm wide when fully stretched, as well as 60 cm tall. The
                Holland Lop's flesh is known to be muscular and well-toned. This
                is especially true when applied to high ranking show Holland
                Lops.They have "short, rounded noses," which differentiates them
                from other lop breeds, such as the mini lop.Holland Lops usually
                weigh between 2-4 pounds. However, according to ARBA show
                standards, the Holland Lop at maximum weight, is 4 pounds.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span>Behaviour:</span> Holland Lops, as a breed are considered
                to be very calm rabbits even though they tend to come off as shy
                at first. As a result of this, owners can expect to spend time
                playing and relaxing with their Lops. In addition to exercise,
                Holland Lops also require toys to chew on. This is not only
                important for keeping them occupied, but also for avoiding
                potential dilemmas. If neglected, this could ensue in the
                destruction of personal items, or even walls, as reported by
                some owners.As a whole, the Holland Lop is considered to be a
                very friendly breed. Although there is individual variation for
                each rabbit, this is what is reported. Also, Male rabbits, or
                bucks, have been reported to be less nippy than female rabbits,
                although they do tend to experience a stage where they are shyer
                and nippy. This typically occurs when they would like to be
                bred. However, does are often much neater than bucks. Bucks have
                been known to exhibit destructive behavior, often resulting in
                ruined cages.

                <span>Description:</span>The Silver Fox rabbit is a rare breed
                of domestic rabbit developed by Walter B. Garland of North
                Canton, Ohio, and bred for meat, show, and its unique fur. The
                breed is recognized by the American Rabbit Breeders Association.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span>Appearance:</span> The Silver Fox is a large, docile breed
                that is excellent with children. Senior bucks should weigh 9-11
                pounds and senior does should weigh 10-12 pounds. The breed is
                named for its dense, unique fur which is to closely resembles
                the pelt of the silver fox. The fur of the Silver Fox rabbit is
                unique in that it is classified as "stand up" fur; it stands on
                end until stroked back into place. The Silver Fox is the only
                breed accepted by ARBA that has stand up fur; by ARBA standard
                the fur is ideally 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) in length. The Silver Fox
                breed is classified as "Commercial" by ARBA. This means that the
                ideal shape of the Silver Fox is to provide the maximum amount
                of meat in the prime cuts of the carcass. Well-filled, wide,
                straight hindquarters; a deep profile which allows for a deep
                loin; body width equal to the depth of the hindquarters; and a
                short shoulder all are ideal components of any commercial breed,
                including the Silver Fox. Currently, only black and chocolate
                Silver Foxes can be shown to win best of breed, but the breed
                comes in a variety of colors, such as blue, lilac, and white,
                which can be shown with permission from the show runners and
                with a working standard. Chocolate was recently accepted as an
                official variety as of the 2021 ARBA convention. As of December
                of 2021 they can be shown against black Silver Fox and win best
                of breed and best opposite sex. Blue was previously included in
                the breed standard, but was removed in the 1970s due to a
                decrease in the number of blue Silver Fox rabbits being shown.
                Currently, there is a "Certificate of Development" for blue
                Silver Foxes to be re-accepted into the ARBA. Blue silver fox
                can be shown in ARBA recognized shows for exhibition. Though
                rare, there are tortoise shell colored silver foxes, which are
                being used to recreate the now extinct breed known as the
                Alaskan Red Fox. It is unknown if the Alaskan Red Fox will be a
                proposed variety for the silver fox or a different breed
                entirely.

                <span>Description:</span>The Cinnamon rabbit is a breed of
                domesticated rabbit created "accidentally" in 1962 and named for
                its coat color. The Cinnamon is currently recognized by the
                American Rabbit Breeders Association (ARBA) but not by the
                British Rabbit Council (BRC).
              </p>
              <p>
                <span>Appearance:</span> Named for its distinct coloration, the
                Cinnamon rabbit's coat is ideally rust or ground cinnamon with a
                uniform gray ticking across the back, smoky grey coloring on its
                sides, a dark underbelly, and an orange under-color all over.
                Rust-colored spots appear inside the hind legs and often also on
                the feet and face. The hind legs, feet, and face are generally
                darker than the rest of the body, producing a butterfly effect
                on the nose and small circles around each eye. The Cinnamon,
                weighing 8.5-11 pounds (3.9-5.0 kg), is medium in length and has
                a commercial body. The hips are deeper and wider than the
                shoulders, the head is proportionate to the body, and the ears
                are erect. The ARBA standard for the Cinnamon rabbit awards, of
                the total 100 points, 58 points for body type: ideally a good,
                medium-sized body with smooth bone structure and good filled in
                flesh. The overall coloring and coat quality is awarded 11
                points, with another 11 points for desired markings and color
                variations, including varying shades of rust and brown on the
                body and belly, plus a lighter gray dusting along the back.
              </p>
              <p>
                <span>Behaviour:</span> The Cinnamon is adapted and suitable to
                be kept as a pet, and is large enough for children, who are
                advised against keeping smaller breeds due to their delicate
                nature, but also advised against keeping giant breeds as they
                may be too large to handle. The Cinnamon is a hardy breed—it
                tends to live between 5 and 8 years—and is laidback, fairly
                calm, well disposed, and enjoys attention. Its coat is short and
                easy to care for, so weekly grooming with a slicker brush should
                be adequate for the majority of the year. However, biweekly
                grooming may be necessary during the shedding season. The
                Cinnamon, like any breed of rabbit, will benefit from a
                well-balanced diet, plenty of room to exercise, various toys to
                chew on, and plenty of time spent with its owner.

                rabbit rather than a true hare. Averaging 6-9 pounds (2.7-4.1
                kg), the Belgian Hare is known for its slender and wiry frame
                and its long and powerful legs.

                <span>Appearance:</span> The Belgian Hare is most known for its
                distinctively close resemblance to a hare, with a long, fine
                body with muscular flank, and distinctly arched back with loins
                and well-rounded hind quarters. Their head is long and their
                tail straight and carried in line with the backbone. The fore
                feet of a Belgian Hare are usually long and fine-boned and
                perfectly straight, while their hind feet are long, fine, and
                flat. They are believed to be the only breed of domestic rabbit
                featuring a deep red, rich chestnut color of the Belgian Hare,
                together with black ticking of a wavy or blotchy appearance and
                an extended down the sides. In the USA, Rufus Red coloration is
                the only variety recognized. The BRC now recognizes both Black
                and Tan (called the Tan Hare), and Black Hares in addition to
                the Rufus Red.

                <span>Behaviour:</span> The Belgian Hare is one of the most
                intelligent and energetic breeds of rabbit, with the potential
                to train rabbits to become responsive to the sound of their
                name. Due to their active nature and alert temperament, they can
                very easily be startled by sudden noise or movement. As a result
                of their active personality, they have been called "the poor
                man's racehorse". The Belgian Hare is known to be responsive to
                handling, particularly when trained from an early age, however,
                it is recommended that the Belgian Hare should not be handled by
                children mainly due to their large size and speed that may cause
                injury.

          <h3>Their teeth never stop growing</h3>
          <p>
            Rabbit teeth continue to grow throughout their lives, so it's
            important to feed them mostly grass and hay, which helps wear down
            the teeth to a normal size. The act of chewing on hay, plus the
            natural abrasive qualities of silica in grass, naturally wears the
            teeth to prevent them from becoming too long.

          <h3>Rabbits express their happiness through 'binkies'</h3>
          <p>
            A fun fact about rabbits is that when they're at their most happy,
            they make an expression that's commonly called a binky. When a
            rabbit binkies, they jump up into the air and twist their head and
            body in opposite directions, either from standing still or running.
            A quick flick of the head and ears is also called a half-binky which
            is another sign of playfulness. A binky is your rabbit's way of
            telling you that they're happy with you and their life in general -
            so keep up the good work.

          <h3>Rabbits are born with their eyes shut</h3>
          <p>
            Rabbits are born with their eyes shut. Once their eyes open, they
            have 360-degree vision meaning it's difficult to sneak up on a
            rabbit. They do have a small blind spot directly in front of their
            face.

        <div>
          <h3>They are very fast</h3>
          <p>
            Rabbits can move at speeds of around 18mph. Couple that with their
            ability to jump between 3-4ft high and over 9ft horizontally and
            it's hard to imagine ever being able to catch an escaped rabbit.
            Ensure that all fences are of adequate height if your rabbit is
            allowed to roam in the garden.

          <h3>Rabbits can't vomit</h3>
          <p>
            Rabbits are very hygienic and self-groom in much the same way that a
            cat does. However, the rabbit digestive system does not move in
            reverse, meaning rabbits cannot bring up hairballs. They deal with
            the swallowed fur by eating plenty of roughage, this enables them to
            push it through their digestive tract.

          <h3>They're natural recyclers</h3>
          <p>
            As part of their natural diet, rabbits eat a specific kind of their
            own droppings called caecotrophs. These are full of protein and
            vitamin B, and your rabbit eats them to maximise the nutrients they
            get from their food.
