                standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown
                printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type

                the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially
                unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of

                recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker
